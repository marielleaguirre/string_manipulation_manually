# index() return the first location of the function parameter in the string. 
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using index() function.

# ask user for string input and the word/substring to find
# use for loop to loop through the string to find the first occurrence
# if a match is found, print the index and break the loop
# if no match is found after the loop, print a message saying it was not found
